        <p id="p1">Hello, my name is Raghad Sawalhi. Welcome to my website.</p>
        
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        
        <p id="p2">I graduated from Princess Sumaya University for Technology (PSUT) in 2018. I majored in Computer Engineering,
            and I graduated with a Very Good academic status. 
            <br>
            After my graduation,I took some time off and traveled for two months and after ny return to amman, I landed an internship
            at an NGO called Humanity and Inclusion (HI) as a Technical Support Officer.

            <br>
            I quickly realized that my true passion in life is <em>teaching</em> and that teaching is what I want to do.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            I now work as a Teaching Assistant (TA) at LTUC - Abd AlAziz AlGhurair School for Advanced Technology in the new coding program. <br>
            <br>
            I aspire to become a lecturer in the near future.
